# DiceDB CLI

A command-line interface for [DiceDB](https://dicedb.io).

## Get Started

```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh
```

## Features

- **Interactive Prompt**: Provides an interactive shell to execute DiceDB commands.
- **Command Autocompletion**: Offers autocompletion for DiceDB commands when typing.
- **Watch Commands**: Supports custom `.WATCH` and `.UNWATCH` commands to reactively receive updated results of specific commands.
- **Authentication**: Supports `AUTH` command to authenticate with the DiceDB server.

## Prerequisites

- **Go version 1.23** or later recommended
- **DiceDB Server**: A running instance of DiceDB. You can find setup instructions on the [DiceDB GitHub page](https://github.com/dicedb/dice).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DiceDB/dicedb-cli.git
   cd dicedb-cli
   ```

2. **Download Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Build the Application**:

   ```bash
   go build -o dicedb-cli
   ```

   This will generate an executable named `dicedb-cli` in the current directory.

## Usage

### Starting the CLI

Run the executable to start the interactive prompt:

```bash
./dicedb-cli
```

You should see:

```
Connected to DiceDB. Type 'exit' or press Ctrl+D to exit.
dicedb>
```

### Basic Commands

You can execute any DiceDB command directly:

```bash
dicedb> SET mykey "Hello, World!"
OK
dicedb> GET mykey
"Hello, World!"
dicedb> DEL mykey
(integer) 1
```

### Watch Commands

Receive updated results of supported commands using their `.WATCH` variants. These commands keep the prompt in a persistent state, displaying updates when the monitored data changes.

**Start Watching a Key**:

```bash
dicedb> GET.WATCH mykey
```

The prompt changes to indicate watch mode:

```
dicedb(get.watch)>
```

**Receive Updates**:

When the value of `mykey` changes, the new value is displayed:

```
Command: GET
Fingerprint: 1234567890
Data: "New Value"
```

**Stop Watching a Key**:

To exit the watch mode, use the corresponding `.UNWATCH` command: 
```bash
dicedb(get.watch)> GET.UNWATCH 1234567890 # Use the fingerprint from the watch output
```
Output
```
OK
dicedb>
```

### Exiting the CLI

Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D` to exit the CLI:

```bash
dicedb> exit
```

## Command Autocompletion

The CLI provides autocompletion for DiceDB commands when typing the first word. Start typing a command and press `Tab` to see suggestions:

```bash
dicedb> S    # Press Tab
```

Suggestions:

- `SET`
- `SUBSCRIBE`
- `SADD`
- `SCAN`
